# Turtle Racing Game
---------------------

## Overview

The Turtle Racing Game is a simple Python game built using the Turtle graphics module. The game features seven turtles, each representing a color of the rainbow. Players are prompted to bet on the turtle they think will win the race. The turtles then race across the screen, and the winner's color is compared with the player's bet to determine the outcome.

## Project Structure

### Files

- **race_main.py:** The main file containing the game logic and user interaction.
- **race_utils.py:** A utility module providing functions for drawing the starting and finishing lines.

### Code Highlights

- **Colorful Turtles:** Each turtle corresponds to a color of the rainbow, making the game visually appealing.
- **User Bet Prompt:** The game prompts the user to bet on a winning turtle before the race begins.
- **Random Movement:** Turtles move forward a random distance in each step, adding an element of unpredictability.
- **Race Visualization:** The Turtle graphics module is used to draw starting and finishing lines and visually represent the race.

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the `race_main.py` file using a Python interpreter.
3. A prompt will appear asking you to bet on a turtle. Enter a color of the rainbow (VIBGYOR).
4. Watch the turtles race across the screen.
5. The winner's color will be displayed, and the game will announce whether you won or lost based on your bet.
